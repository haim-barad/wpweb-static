Root directory: (leave empty)
Node.js version: 18
```

### 3. Domain Configuration for wpweb.org

## Deployment Commands & Settings

### Exact Cloudflare Pages Settings:
```
Framework preset: None
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
Root directory: (empty)
Environment variables: (none required)
```

### Your Current Build Scripts:
```json
{
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build", 
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "test": "node scripts/test-accessibility.js"
}
```

## Migration Strategy Recommendation

### Option A: Safe Migration (Recommended)
1. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages** (get yourproject.pages.dev URL)
2. **Test on staging URL** thoroughly
3. **Set up subdomain first**: `new.wpweb.org` â†’ Cloudflare Pages
4. **Test with real users**
5. **Update main domain** `wpweb.org` â†’ Cloudflare Pages

### Option B: Direct Migration
1. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages**
2. **Update DNS immediately** to point wpweb.org to new site
3. **Monitor closely** for any issues

## Pre-Launch Testing

Run these commands before going live:

```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build
npm run preview

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:accessibility

# Check all functionality
open http://localhost:4173
```

## Known Issues to Address (Optional)

The automated testing revealed some non-critical issues:
- Some color contrast ratios could be improved
- Additional responsive breakpoints could be added
- Form labels could be more explicitly associated

These don't prevent deployment but could be addressed post-launch.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Checks:
1. **Contact form**: Test submission works
2. **All pages load**: Check both index.html and services.html
3. **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on various devices
4. **SSL certificate**: Verify HTTPS works

### Analytics Setup:
1. **Google Analytics 4**: Add tracking code if needed
2. **Cloudflare Analytics**: Built-in with Pages
3. **Formspree Dashboard**: Monitor form submissions

## Cost & Performance Benefits

### Current Benefits:
- **Free hosting** on Cloudflare Pages (500 builds/month)
- **Global CDN** with edge caching
- **Automatic SSL** certificate
- **Zero maintenance** static hosting
- **Built-in analytics** and monitoring

### vs Current WordPress Hosting:
- Eliminate server maintenance
- No WordPress security updates needed
- Faster loading times
- Lower hosting costs
- Better security posture

## Support Resources

### If Issues Arise:
1. **Cloudflare Community**: https://community.cloudflare.com/
2. **GitHub Repository**: For code-related issues
3. **Formspree Support**: For contact form issues
4. **DNS Propagation Check**: https://dnschecker.org/

## Timeline Estimate

- **Cloudflare Pages Setup**: 15 minutes
- **DNS Propagation**: 5-15 minutes (up to 48 hours globally)
- **SSL Certificate**: 5-15 minutes
- **Total Go-Live Time**: ~30 minutes to 1 hour

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. **DNS Rollback**: Change DNS records back to current hosting
2. **Cloudflare Rollback**: Use deployment history in Pages dashboard
3. **Both methods**: Usually effective within 5-15 minutes
